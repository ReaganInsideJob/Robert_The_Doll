		<p style="font-family: 'MomsTypewriter', sans-serif;letter-spacing: 3px; line-height:30px; margin: 30px 80px 20px; color: #FF0072">	In the early 1900s, a young boy named Eugene Robert Otto received a cloth doll as a gift. Eugene didn't have children his own age to play with, so he quickly grew fond of the doll and named it Robert. </p>
		<p style="font-family: 'MomsTypewriter', sans-serif;letter-spacing: 3px; line-height:30px; margin: 30px 80px 20px; color: #FF0072">However, it didn't take long for this friendship to take a dark twist. Eugene's parents were frequently awakened by his screams in the middle of the night, rushing to his room to find it in a state of agony. Terrified, the ten-year-old begged his mother to help protect him from the doll. When she turned to look at Robert, she was startled to find him sitting at the foot of the bed. "Robert did it" was a recurring phrase throughout Eugene's childhood. Eugene's parents would often overhear him holding conversations with his doll, only to hear a completely different, deep voice in response. Robert was even caught running through the stairways, laughing, and seen in the windows.</p>
		<p style="font-family: 'MomsTypewriter', sans-serif;letter-spacing: 3px; line-height:30px; margin: 30px 80px 20px; color: #FF0072">Even after Eugene's parents passed away, Robert continued to live with him. Anne, Eugene's wife, felt uneasy around the doll and insisted it be moved into the attic. Robert would get mad, and when guests would come over, they would hear footsteps coming from upstairs and spooky giggles. Even the neighborhood kids would see Robert through the windows. After hearing about this, Eugene would check up on the doll to find him sitting on the rocking chair near the window. Every attempt to lock Robert up, he would continuously reappear in his position by the window.</p>
		<p style="font-family: 'MomsTypewriter', sans-serif;letter-spacing: 3px; line-height:30px; margin: 30px 80px 20px; color: #FF0072">Eugene eventually passed away in 1974, but Robert's spirit continued to live on even after his owner parted. Legend has it that the servant who gave Eugene the doll has placed a curse as a punishment for the mistreatment she endured. When the next family moved into the house, they discovered Robert's wrath. The doll harassed the little girl to the point that she would end up crying and threatened to hurt her. As a result, Robert was given away and now he lives inside a glass case at the East Martello Fort Museum.</p>
