He emphasized the effort to let her go, but some unknown force compelled him to keep her under his possession.</p>
		<p style="font-family: 'MomsTypewriter', sans-serif; letter-spacing: 3px; line-height:30px; margin: 30px 80px 20px; color: #FF0072">In 1972, Walton stumbled upon the doll beneath a porch in an abandoned house located in New South Wales, Australia. He placed the doll in the back of his truck and on his drive back home to Bisbane, he kept hearing screams begging him, "Letta me out". As a result, the doll was known as Letta. </p>

On one occasion, Walton tried to get Letta examined, results stated she was around 200 years old. Furthermore, the doll was revealed to have a head of real Eastern European gypsy hair. The gypsies probably trapped the soul of a drowned boy inside the doll. It's no wonder that whenever Walton tries to take the doll outside, it starts to mysteriously rain. </p>
