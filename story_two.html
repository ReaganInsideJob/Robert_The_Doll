In 1970, a Raggedy-Ann doll was given as a birthday present to a 28-year-old nurse by her mother. Soon, the nurse and her roommate began to notice that the doll would start appearing in spots she was never placed. Strangely, they found notes on parchment paper inside their home, with messages such as "Help me, help us". They never owned parchment paper.</p>
		<p style="font-family: 'MomsTypewriter', sans-serif;letter-spacing: 3px; line-height:30px; margin: 30px 80px 20px; color: #FF0072">One day, a male friend was taking a nap when he abruptly woke up with a sensation that he was being strangled. To his horror, he saw the doll staring at him and discovered scratches on his body.</p>
		<p style="font-family: 'MomsTypewriter', sans-serif;letter-spacing: 3px; line-height:30px; margin: 30px 80px 20px; color: #FF0072">The roommates took the doll to a medium, who revealed that it was inhabited by the spirit of Annabelle Higgins, a 7-year-old girl who died before the building became an apartment. The spirit wanted to remain with them and the roommates agreed that Annabelle could coexist with the doll. </p>
		<p style="font-family: 'MomsTypewriter', sans-serif;letter-spacing: 3px; line-height:30px; margin: 30px 80px 20px; color: #FF0072">Upon hearing about the case, Lorraine and Ed Warren took interest and contacted the nurse. Though it didn't take long to discover that it was not a human spirit that possessed the doll but an "inhuman presence". Currently, the doll is locked up in Warren's Occult Museum. </p>
